# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree
This repository contains my projects for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.

## Project 1: Exploring Weather Trends
In this project, I analysed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

## Project 2: Investigate a Dataset
In this project I chose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and Pandas. I went through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing my findings.

## Project 3: Analyse A/B Test Results
In this project I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal was to help the company understand if they should implement the new page design.

## Project 4: Wrangle and Analyse Data
This project required me to gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. I showcased my wrangling efforts through analyses and visualsations.

## Project 5: Communicate Data Findings
In this project I chose the FordGoBike dataset, and performed an exploratory data analysis using Python. Then, I created a presentation with explanatory plots that conveyed my findings.
